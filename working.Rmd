Should use this document for actual operations and keep actual functions in another document for the public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mattbk/ledgerr). Shiny will be set up at https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard.

```{r}
# Use https://github.com/maxconway/gsheet
library(gsheet)

# Pull Google sheet locations from another file (journal1, journal2, etc.)
source("config.R")

# Combine bank accounts
journal<-rbind(journal1,journal2)

## Clean up
# Date is date
journal$Date<-as.Date(journal$Date,format="%m/%d/%Y")
# Debit and Credit are numeric, without commas
journal$Debit<-as.numeric(sub(",","",journal$Debit))
journal$Credit<-as.numeric(sub(",","",journal$Credit))

# Start thinking about reports
# All time net, should be function
net<-sum(journal$Credit,na.rm=T)-sum(journal$Debit,na.rm=T)

# Net by class and date range, should be function

# See other reports in QB and Ledger
